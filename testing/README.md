# Comparison of C++ algorithm results:

The above folders include the results from testing each respective instance of the algorithm.

The "exp_testing" folder contains the results and required files for testing the exponential
algorithm. 

The "rec_testing" folder contains the results and required files for testing the rectangular
window algorithm.

(For all the following steps, the correct paths to your respective system need to be configured 
depending on where the "rls" folder from the repository is located.)

To properly simulate and check the results, the steps are as follows:
1. Configure the output signal from the "Mat_Maker.cpp" in the "examples folder"
2. Run "RLS_testing.cpp" to get results and configure the objects accordingly if you want 
to check different parameters.
3. In each folder , run the .m files to get the graphed results. 
4. Check the "images" in the folder and compare to the MATLAB operations.
